# Some permission/config stuff
#
### enabled_worlds: Specifies, on which worlds the Safaris should work
# e.g.: On Non-freebuild servers there usually is a "peaceful" world with no mobs spawning
# and people building their homes. If such people would posess a Mob-spawner in their cellars,
# they could easily cheat on Safaris...
### admin_permission: this setting defines the permission which is necessary to set "safari.enabled_worlds".
# may be used together with a permissions-plugin like PEX?    
# the Plugin uses: if(player.hasPermission(config.get("safari.admin_permission"))) {} to
# filter the command (or if the command comes from the servers console, which is always an indicator for admin ;) )
